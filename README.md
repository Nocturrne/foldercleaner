# foldercleaner

This is a simple Python script to walk through a specific depth of folders and delete folders older than a specific age.

- I created this script to automatically delete old security camera videos without deleting the top level folder for each camera.
- Only walks through a specific subfolder depth, instead of walking through all of the folders
- Set the path, folder depth, and age to customize to your application
- I put this in the cron to run nightly, in my case
